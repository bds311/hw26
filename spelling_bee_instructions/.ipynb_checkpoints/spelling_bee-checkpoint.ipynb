    "# NYT Spelling Bee Re-creation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will outline instructions to complete a challenge problem which involves making a python re-creation of the new york times spelling bee game.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the link to the actual game for reference: https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Game Description:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The NYT spelling bee starts by giving the player 7 unique letters. One of these letters is highlighted as the \"center letter\".       \n",
    "The goal is to find as many words as possible using the given letters.\n",
    "- Words must be at least 4 letters long\n",
    "- Words must contain the \"center\" letter\n",
    "- Letters can be used more than once\n",
    "\n",
    "The player earns points with each word guessed. Extra points are awarded if the guessded word is a `pangram`.  \n",
    "In the context of the game, pangrams are words which use all 7 unique letters at least once.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### **Selection process for 7 unique letters:**\n",
    "To ensure that a pangram is possible for each selection of 7 unique letters, the 7 unique letters for the game are obtained by getting the set of letters from a randomly selected pangram.  \n",
    "#### **Game Data:**\n",
    "We provide english.txt which contains most english words (*not filtered for profanity*). Use this as the word bank for the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Python Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend implementing the game by printing text and asking for user inputs, although you do have the freedom to try an implement a graphical interface or any other method you see fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Game Mechanics**\n",
    "\n",
    "After selecting 7 unique letters (obtained from a randomly selected pangram within english.txt), these letters must be displayed to the player in some way. Additionally, one letter must be randomly selected to be the \"center letter\" and highlighted a different color than the other letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The player then must be able to input a guess and get feedback. Feedback includes...\n",
    "- If the word is a valid word (uses center letter, is at leat 4 letters long, and only uses the given 7 letters), record the word in a list and display this list to the player to see which words they have already guessed.\n",
    "    - If the word is a pangram using the 7 given letters, then let the player know they guessed a pangram.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Give feedback on a wrong guess if the word is either \n",
    "    - Too short (less than 4 letters)\n",
    "    - Doesn't use the center letter\n",
    "    - Has letters not in the list of 7 given letters\n",
    "    - not a real word (or at least not a word in english.txt)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Meta**\n",
    "Allow the player to quit or start a new game by inputing specific letters\n",
